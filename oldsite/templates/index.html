            <p class="about-text">
                Formerly from a background in primarily engineering, I retrained as a web developer,
                bringing with me a love of problem-solving, strong attention to detail and a focus on UX.
                Throughout my career, I have worked in highly skilled roles that involved interacting with the public
                and colleagues to find practical solutions to technical problems. My career change was prompted by
                discovering a love for writing code to benefit my own projects working with microcontrollers and
                automation.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
                My current skill set is
                focused on HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, Python3, Flask, Django, Mysql, MongoDB, AWS and C++, but I am
                currently upskilling in React.js and PHP. <br>I am a highly focused and driven individual who is used to
                working independently, however, I enjoy collaborative working and the opportunity to learn from others.
                I am a quick learner and always on the lookout for a new challenge, whether it be in coding, electronics
                or attempting to cultivate veg on my allotment.
